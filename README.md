:LEGISLATIVE NOTATION:
- Section 109 of the Constitution of Australia states that; "When a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid."
- The Vaccine mandate in effect on 17th December 2021 or when the 80% COVID vaccination target is met is invalid for me and any other sincear religious persons, as law of the Commonwealth of Australia in the Anti-Discrimination Act 1998 protects the rights of religious persons and their respective belife prevails above all State mandates.
- The Federal Legislation above in the respected "Acts" lists that any discrimination, refusal of entry, and any other forms of abuse and discriminatory acts against me for my lack of vaccination by religious belief is unlawful as my lack of vaccination is proven by my strong religious and spiritual beliefs against worldy and sinful ways. Further information can be found in the 1611KJV. 
- Further details are listed in the PDF labelled "RELIGIOUS_EXEMPTION01"
- Thank you for your understanding :)
