- The Vaccine mandate in effect on 17th December 2021 or when the 80% COVID vaccination target is met is invalid for me and any other sincear religious persons, as law of the Commonwealth of Australia prevails over state mandate.
- The Federal Legislation above in the respected "Acts" list that any discrimination, refusal of entry, and any other forms of abuse and discriminatory acts against me for my lack of vaccination and religious beliefes is unlawful as my lack of vaccination (refusal of forced compliance to worldly and sinful ways) is a religious right (1611KJV).
